# Blog Post Back-End (NodeJS, NoSQL)

Replicated the same back-end functionality as my Blog Post Golang Back-End using NodeJS (ExpressJS) and MongoDB, employing Mongoose as the ORM. Adhered to best practices and idiomatic NodeJS coding standards. A stateless JWT token workflow was integrated. Errors are handled properly.
